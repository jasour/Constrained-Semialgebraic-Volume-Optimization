Semidefinite Programming for Constrained Semialgebraic Volume Optimization: Application in System and Control



**Description:**

We aim at maximizing the volume of a semialgebraic set under some semialgebraic constraints; i.e., let S1(a) and
S2(a) be semialgebraic sets described by set of polynomial inequalities where "a" denotes the vector of design parameters. 
The objective is to find a parameter vector "a" such that maximizes the volume of the set S1(a) with respect to distribution µ(x) under the constraint S1(a) ⊆ S2(a).
 

Sup_a Volume_{µ(x)} (S1(a))\
s.t.\
S1(a)  ⊆ S2(a)
